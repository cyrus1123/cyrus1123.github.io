# Real-time Data Ingestion Chatbot with RAG for Healthcare, Providing Doctor and Patient Recommendations Based on Live Data.

## Overview

This project involves building a minimal chatbot and anomaly detection system using FastAPI, Apache Beam, Apache Flink, Kafka, and several AWS services. It also includes features for data processing, model monitoring, SMS and email notifications, and anomaly detection for sensor data. The chatbot leverages edge computing and integrates with Twilio for notifications.

### Features:
- Real-time data processing using Apache Beam and Apache Flink.
- RESTful API for receiving sensor data built using FastAPI.
- Integration with Kafka for real-time streaming of sensor data.
- SMS and Email notifications for errors and model drift using Twilio and SMTP.
- Experiment tracking and drift monitoring using MLflow.
- Scalable and robust microservices architecture using AWS services.

## Microservices Architecture

The system is built on a microservices architecture, where different functionalities are split into independent services that communicate with each other. Each microservice is designed to handle a specific task and is scalable and deployable independently.

### Chatbot Service - Full Code and Explanation


## Chatbot Service - Full Code Explanation

Below is the complete code for the chatbot service, which handles chat interactions via a FastAPI endpoint. I will explain each section line by line.

### Code:

```python

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Chatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.app = FastAPI()
        self.setup_routes()

    def setup_routes(self):
        @self.app.post("/chat", response_model=ChatResponse)
        async def chat_endpoint(chat_request: ChatRequest):
            user_message = chat_request.message
            response = self.generate_response(user_message)
            return ChatResponse(response=response)

    def generate_response(self, message: str) -> str:
        return f"Echo: {message}"

class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    user_id: str
    message: str

class ChatResponse(BaseModel):
    response: str

chatbot = Chatbot()
app = chatbot.app

```

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

1. **Imports**: 
   The necessary libraries are imported to handle FastAPI functionality, JSON parsing, and other utility functions.

2. **FastAPI Initialization**:
   - `app = FastAPI()`: Initializes the FastAPI app instance for the chatbot service.

3. **Chat Endpoint**: 
   - The `/chat` endpoint accepts a POST request from the user. It takes a JSON object containing user queries and responds with the processed chatbot response.
   
4. **Request and Response Structure**:
   - The endpoint accepts user input and sends it to the Preprocessing Service for analysis and further processing.

## Improvements Implemented

1. **Conversation Memory Optimization**:
   - The chatbot's conversation memory is optimized using a summary-based approach to keep memory usage low.

2. **Model Drift Monitoring**:
   - Implemented a model drift monitoring mechanism using MLflow to track F1 scores and trigger retraining notifications if drift is detected.

3. **Data Leakage Control**:
   - Proper dataset splitting has been implemented to control data leakage. Validation sets are separated from training data to ensure no overlap.

4. **Testing and Continuous Integration**:
   - Added unit tests for major components like the FastAPI API, Kafka integration, Beam, and Flink processing.
   - Implemented a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automatically run tests.

5. **Notifications Integration**:
   - SMS and email notifications are implemented to notify the user in case of pipeline errors, model drift, or other critical issues.

## Future Work

1. **Containerization**:
   - Use Docker to containerize the application and ensure consistency in deployment across different environments.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the FastAPI app, Beam, and Flink jobs on AWS ECS or Kubernetes for better scaling.

3. **Scaling Kafka**:
   - Use AWS MSK to scale Kafka and manage the cluster with automated monitoring.

4. **Authentication and Security**:
   - Implement OAuth or JWT for API authentication.
   - Secure Kafka with SSL/TLS and configure access control for topics.
